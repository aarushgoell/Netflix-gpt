Netflix GPT : 

We are building a project very similar to netflix. A App where you can go and see a list of movies 

feature of the proj:

-> How authentication works. we will be using google firebase to have our backend. And then we will connect our react application to the firebase backend 

-> How you can protect the routes from authentication. If the user is logged in then only go to certain page.

We will also cover form. How to handle a signin form , login form 

It is a kind of mix of netflix  +  gpt 

We are going to use chatgpt APIs to search for movie.

Where we will give input box and user can write anything. I dont know what movie to watch, if i want to watch a funny indian movie so recommend me some 

netflix gpt will use its gpt power and will search for your new amazing cool movie and we will give him suggestions

If i want to watch some funmy movie like 3 ediots. so it will give you suggestions 

i installed npm create vite@latest 

Features :

   -> Login/Sign Up page/ 
      -Sign In / Sign up form 
      - once you are logged in redirect to browse page 

 -> Browser 
    - Header 
    - Main Movie 
        - Trailer in background
        - Title and description and play     button 
        - Movie suggestions
          - MOvie lists * N

  => Netflix GPT 
      - Search bar 
      - Movie suggestions 


Browser page comes when you are logged in (after authentication)

if you are not authenticated then there is a home page where u have the option of sign in 
Login/Sign up page  

Once you sign in then it will go to browse page 

if you are directly going to browser page then it will take you to the browser page 
redirect to browse page 


===================================


text-3xl will increase the font of the project 


First we have made Login Comp, then header , then body, then browse and exported my Body comp in App.js 

In Body comp there we are importing Login and browse comp 

Its neccessary to name file with .jsx other wise it will give error 


======================


Now we will do routing in out project install npm install react-router-dom

 and changes we will do in body 

 import Browser from "./Browse";
import Login from "./Login";

import { createBrowserRouter,RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";

const Body = () => {
  const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
    {
      path: "/",
      element: <Body></Body>,
    },

    {
      path: "/browse",
      element: <Browse />,
    },
  ]);

  return (
    <div>
      <RouterProvider router={appRouter}/>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Body;

and we can only router to browse page only when we are authenticated 


====================

Now we will build our login screen , so first of all we will build our header 


header will be having a netflix logo 

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <div className="absolute px-6 py-2 bg-gradient-to-b from-black">
      <img
        src="
https://help.nflxext.com/helpcenter/OneTrust/oneTrust_production/consent/87b6a5c0-0104-4e96-a291-092c11350111/01938dc4-59b3-7bbc-b635-c4131030e85f/logos/dd6b162f-1a32-456a-9cfe-897231c7763c/4345ea78-053c-46d2-b11e-09adaef973dc/Netflix_Logo_PMS.png"
        alt="logo"
        className="w-46 "
      ></img>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Header;


Now we will build our login form 

When ever we build a form w always need a validation to it 

when you have to built alot of details then always use a library known as formic 

When fields becomes a lot then managing validation , handling errors in a big form becomes very difficult 

Now right now we will teach how we can write validation inside our form 

This is our login page till now :=>

import { useState } from "react";
import Header from "./Header";

const Login = () => {
  const [isSignin, setisSignIn] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div>
      <Header></Header>
      <div className="absolute">
        <img src="	https://assets.nflxext.com/ffe/siteui/vlv3/fb5cb900-0cb6-4728-beb5-579b9af98fdd/web/IN-en-20250127-TRIFECTA-perspective_cf66f5a3-d894-4185-9106-5f45502fc387_large.jpg" />
      </div>
      <form className="absolute w-3/12 m-45 p-12 mx-auto left-0 right-0 text-white bg-black backdrop-opacity-5">
        <h1 className="font-bold text-left text-3xl my-3 ml-2 text-white">
          {isSignin ? "Sign in" : "Sign Up"}
        </h1>
        {isSignin == false && (
          <input
            type="text"
            placeholder="Name"
            className="px-4 py-2 m-2  bg-gray-900 text-gray-400 w-full rounded-sm"
          ></input>
        )}
        <input
          type="text"
          placeholder="Email address"
          className="px-4 py-2 m-2  bg-gray-900 text-gray-400 w-full rounded-sm"
        ></input>
        <input
          type="password"
          placeholder="Password"
          className="px-4 py-2 m-2 bg-gray-900 text-gray-400 w-full rounded-sm"
        ></input>
        <button className="px-4 py-2 m-2 bg-red-700 w-full rounded-sm cursor-pointer">
          {isSignin ? "Sign in" : "Sign Up"}
        </button>
        <p
          className="py-3 cursor-pointer"
          onClick={() => {
            setisSignIn(!isSignin);
          }}
        >
          {isSignin ? "Not a User? Sign Up now" : "Already a User ? Sign in"}
        </p>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Login;

// in login page we have a header and then we have a sign in page


We will learn useRef hook also 

Either we can create stack variables or we can use reference of that input box 

useref will create a ref and that email will be a reference to the input box 

when we are submitting the form it is refreshing the whole page i want to stop it from submitting it 

We can add name validation as well 

const handleButtonClick = () => {
    // validate the form data

    console.log(email.current.value);
    console.log(password.current.value);

    const message = checkValidData(email.current.value, password.current.value);

    setErrorMessage(message);
  };

  Go to utils/validate.js that is validation code

  Now we will do authentication

  We will be using firebase for authenticating 
  
  We have till now deplyed our app 

  the commands used is we also habe to install firebase inour app and also itde dev tools 

npm install -g firebase-toolsy

firebase login 
firebase init ,select hosting
firebase deploy 
The deployed link will work fine in ingonito 


Now we will create a new user and sign in a user 


  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    // validate the form data

    console.log(email.current.value);
    console.log(password.current.value);

    const message = checkValidData(email.current.value, password.current.value);
    setErrorMessage(message);

    if (message) {
      return;
    }

    // Sign In/ Sign up logic here
    // create a new user

    if (!isSignin) {
      createUserWithEmailAndPassword(
        auth,
        email.current.value,
        password.current.value
      )
        .then((userCredential) => {
          // Signed up
          const user = userCredential.user;
          console.log(user);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          const errorCode = error.code;
          const errorMessage = error.message;
          setErrorMessage(errorCode + "-" + errorMessage);
        });
    } else {
      signInWithEmailAndPassword(
        auth,
        email.current.value,
        password.current.value
      )
        .then((userCredential) => {
          // Signed in
          const user = userCredential.user;
          console.log(user);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          const errorCode = error.code;
          const errorMessage = error.message;
          setErrorMessage(errorCode + "-" + errorMessage);
        });
    }
  };


  We will store the information of user in redux toolkit 


Now you will notive that we are able to move to browse route and this is only for authenticated and payed users 

And if i am not signed in , it should redirect me to the login page 

if the user is logged in then it will move to browser page 

Body comp is the parent comp and routing is happending inside the body comp and we cant use navigate outside of the Body component 

I will add the useEffect to a place which is there in my whole app and which is also there in my Router Provider 

One best place to put my useEffect is inside my header component 


and when the component will load , everytime useEffect will be called , So when my component will unmount ,i will unsubscribe from the event also 

onAuthStateChanged returns a unsubscribe function and i will call this unsubscribe function it will remove this onAuthStateChanged from our browser 

so i will unsubscribe it when my header component unloads

  React does some extra rendering of your components to check some inconsistency between your calls and this only happens in development mode and it will throw an error if there is inconsistency in your cycle 

  We are creating a movie slice in which we will put all the movies data 

  Creating your own custom Hook 

  We have created a title component


  Introduction to GTP 

  Now we will create a seperate page that will be a GPT search page 

  In that you will be having a search bar.

  Some time it happens that i dont know which movie to watch, I just want to type something in the search bar and want that chat gpt , the GPT-API will give me the results what movie to watch.

  Using GPT as the movie recommendation system 

  which netflix has a good recommendation system but why not gpt will recommend movies to us.

  Suppose i want to search for old hindi bollywood movies which are funny so give me suggestions so GPT can use its knowledge and can recommend me some movie out of it 

  we will be using GPT API which is built by open AI.

  We will plug those APIS in frontend API and will use it.
  We will ask him alot of questions and it will give me some results
